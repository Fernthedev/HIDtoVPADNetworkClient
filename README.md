# HIDtoVPADNetworkClient

A Java application to send data from various controllers to [HID to VPAD](https://github.com/Maschell/hid_to_vpad); a homebrew application for the Wii U.

Using this client, you can use unsuported devices such as XBox 360 controllers with HID to VPAD!

Please check the releases page for the latest feature list; as this program is under heavy development and is still incomplete. At this point only Linux /dev/input controllers are supported.

A sample HID to VPAD .ini for an XBox 360 controller on /dev/input/js0 (the path determines the VID/PID when using Linux controllers) can be found [here](https://puu.sh/tHYS4/d73791d987.ini).
